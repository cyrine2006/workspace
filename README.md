# Workspace

This repository is my personal workspace for learning and practicing technical skills.

I use this repo to:
- Learn Git and GitHub
- Practice automation concepts
- Experiment with AI tools and workflows
- Keep notes and small projects

This is a learning-focused repository and will evolve over time as I build more skills.
